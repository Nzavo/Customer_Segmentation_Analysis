# Customer-Segmentation
This repository contains code for customer segmentation using RFM formula and clustering

The data if for an e-commerce platform for a period of one month, from 1st to 31st July 2023. This data contains 1 million records. I performed RFM Analysis in order to rank and segment customers based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value of a transaction. I then used KMeans model to cluster the customers into 2 groups.
Finally, i calculated the 2 clusters characteristics by comparing there differences based on the following criteria:
*Number of customers
*Sales contribution
*Margin contribution
*Monthly spend
*Shopping frequency
